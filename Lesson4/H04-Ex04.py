# Problem 4: Online Shopping Cart
# Create a Python program that simulates an online shopping cart using a global dictionary
# variable. Every customer has unique id as a key. Define functions to add items to the cart,
# remove items, calculate the total price, and display the contents of the cart. Allow the user to
# interact with the cart by adding and removing items.
